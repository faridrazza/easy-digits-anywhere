Web App Concept: “Register-to-Excel Digitization Portal”
What It Is
A simple web application that helps small shopkeepers and business owners convert handwritten register entries into clean Excel tables—quickly, securely, and without any tech knowledge.

Who It’s For
Local business owners (starting with Ranchi) who still use physical notebooks or registers to track their daily sales, expenses, or inventory.

Users with basic mobile or digital literacy who need a low-cost, hassle-free solution to organize their business data.

Key Features & How It Works
1. Each User Gets a Private Dashboard
Every user has their own account and personal dashboard.

All uploaded files and Excel tables are stored separately—no data is shared between users.

2. Secure Sign-Up & Login
Easy registration using phone or email, with password and OTP verification.

All user data is stored securely.

3. Upload Handwritten Pages
Users can upload images or PDFs of their handwritten registers.

Multiple files can be uploaded at once (bulk upload supported).

Upload status is clearly shown: success, failure, or needs review.

4. Extract Table Data Automatically
The system uses OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to read the uploaded pages.

It extracts rows and columns directly from the handwritten content.

Works especially well with Indian formats, including Hindi and mixed-language handwriting.

5. Create or Update Excel Sheets
After OCR is done, users can:

Create a New Table: Start a new digital record from scratch.

Append to Existing Table: Add new entries to an existing Excel file—perfect for ongoing ledgers.

Users can download the Excel files anytime or view/update them from their dashboard.

6. Simple, Affordable Pricing
Flat rate: ₹99 per month.

No extra cost for bulk uploads (within fair usage).

Transparent, affordable for daily use by small businesses.

7. Built for Local Users
Interface available in Hindi and English.

Menus, instructions, and messages are written in clear, beginner-friendly language.

Fully mobile-friendly so users can do everything from their phones.

Why It’s Better Than Other Options
Append-to-Existing Table feature saves tons of time—no manual merging needed.

Bulk uploads make it fast to digitize weeks or months of data in one go.

Low cost, regional language support, and ease of use make it perfect for Indian small businesses.

Fully focused on the needs of shopkeepers—not generic or bloated with unnecessary features.

Example in Action
A shopkeeper in Ranchi uploads 30 images of her July sales register.
She chooses “Append to Existing Table” to add them to her ongoing ledger.
The system extracts the data, updates the Excel file, and stores it in her dashboard.
She downloads the file or continues using it—no technical help needed.
