# Vercel Deployment Guide

## Issue Fixed: 404 Errors on Client-Side Routes

The 404 errors you were experiencing on routes like `/auth`, `/dashboard`, etc. have been fixed by adding proper Vercel configuration.

## Files Added/Modified

### 1. `vercel.json` (NEW)
This file tells Vercel to redirect all routes to `index.html`, allowing React Router to handle client-side routing.

### 2. `public/_redirects` (NEW)
Alternative routing configuration for additional hosting platform compatibility.

### 3. `vite.config.ts` (UPDATED)
Added build configuration to ensure proper SPA routing.

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Commit and Push Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Vercel routing: Add vercel.json and _redirects for SPA support"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Redeploy on Vercel
- Go to your Vercel dashboard
- Select your project
- Click "Redeploy" or wait for automatic deployment
- The new configuration will be applied automatically

### 3. Test the Routes
After redeployment, test these routes:
- `https://eazyrecord.vercel.app/` (Home page)
- `https://eazyrecord.vercel.app/auth` (Auth page)
- `https://eazyrecord.vercel.app/dashboard` (Dashboard)
- `https://eazyrecord.vercel.app/files/123` (File workspace)

## How It Works

### Before (404 Errors)
- User visits `/auth`
- Vercel looks for `/auth` file/folder
- Not found → 404 error

### After (Working Routes)
- User visits `/auth`
- `vercel.json` rewrites to `/index.html`
- React Router takes over and renders the correct component
- User sees the auth page

## Troubleshooting

If you still see 404 errors after redeployment:

1. **Clear Vercel Cache**: In Vercel dashboard, go to Settings → General → Clear Cache
2. **Check Build Logs**: Ensure the build completed successfully
3. **Verify Configuration**: Make sure `vercel.json` is in the root directory
4. **Wait for Propagation**: DNS changes can take a few minutes

## Additional Notes

- The `vercel.json` configuration is the standard solution for SPAs
- This works for all React Router routes automatically
- No changes needed to your React code
- Works with all modern hosting platforms (Netlify, Vercel, etc.)
